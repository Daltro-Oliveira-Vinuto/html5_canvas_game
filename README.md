<h2>
This game is a copy from the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BHs1BzA4fs&t=923s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org. 
The name of the video is "Code a 2D Game Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (w/ Free Game Assets) â€“ Tutorial" from the channel FreeCodeCamp on Youtube.

I copied that game solely for the porpuse of learning to make games in javascript and to practice javascript programming.
I changed the original code from Javascript to his superset Typescript.
I changed the code to be more clear to me and to be more readable.
I inserted audio using free mp3 files on the internet.
