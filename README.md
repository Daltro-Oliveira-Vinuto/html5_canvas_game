This game is a copy from the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BHs1BzA4fs&t=923s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org. 
The name of the video is "Code a 2D Game Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (w/ Free Game Assets) â€“ Tutorial" from the channel FreeCodeCamp on Youtube.
</p>

<h2> Purpose:</h2>
<p>
I copied that game solely for the porpuse of learning to make games in javascript and to practice javascript/typescript programming.
</p>

<h2> Modifications: </h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        I changed the original code from Javascript to his superset Typescript.
    </li>
    <li>
        I changed the code to be more clear to me and to be more readable by adding comentaries and changing some classes. For example, before the layers were added inside the constructor of the background object then a created a method called addLayer that receive the ID of image and than create a new layer and add to the layers array of the background object.
    </li>
    <li>
        I inserted audio using free mp3 files on the internet.
    </li>

    <li>
        When a hive whale is destroyed by a projectille the object hivewhale call the method addChild to add the drones. Before this change the drones are added directly by the object game in the method update.
    </li>

</ul>
